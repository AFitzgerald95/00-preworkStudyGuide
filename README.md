## Description

- My motivation was to create a viable study guide to use throughout this bootcamp.
- I built this project so that I could have a readily available tool to refer to throughout the bootcamp.
- This Project makes infomration learned in this bootcamp readily available for me.
- I learned the basics for many coding languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along with several other CLI and Git functions.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
